This is a copy of the NetworkManager authentication dialog that used to 
be built as part of OpenConnect itself.

Now that OpenConnect provides a library for the authentication parts, 
there is no more need for us to abuse the NetworkManager auth-dialog.

There's also no need for us to be using the old GConf storage that even
current versions of NetworkManager don't use any more. That was a dirty 
hack, and we should do something saner.
